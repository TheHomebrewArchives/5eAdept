    "druidCircle":"<h2>Circle of Dreams</h2><hr><p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the fey and dreamlike realms. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.</p><h3>Balm of Sunrise</h3><p><i>Circle of Dreams Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the fey. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 40 meters of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.</p><p>You regain all expended dice when you finish an extended rest.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature1":"<h3>Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</h3><p><i>Circle of Dreams Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 10-meter-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.</p><p>While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.</p><p>The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature2":"<h3>Hidden Paths</h3><p><i>Circle of Dreams Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 20 meters to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 10 meters to an unoccupied space you can see.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature3":"<h3>Walker in Dreams</h3><p><i>Circle of Dreams Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, the magic of the fey grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.</p><p>When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle.</p><p>This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

    "druidCircle":"<h2>Circle of the Land</h2><hr><p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p><h3>Bonus Cantrip</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p><h3>Natural Restoration</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a long rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish an extended rest.</p><p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p><h3>Circle Spells</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.</p><p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><table><caption>Arctic</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Coast</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Desert</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Forest</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Grassland</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Mountain</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><table><caption>Swamp</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table>",
    "druidCircleFeature1":"<h3>Land's Stride</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature2":"<h3>Nature's Ward</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature3":"<h3>Nature's Sanctuary</h3><p><i>Circle of the Land Druid Feature</i></p><p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>",

    "druidCircle":"<h2>Circle of the Moon</h2><hr><p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p><p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.</p><h3>Combat Wild Shape</h3><p><i>Circle of the Moon Druid Feature</i></p><p>You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p><p>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p><h3>Circle Forms</h3><p><i>Circle of the Moon Druid Feature</i></p><p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with hit dice as high as 2 (you ignore the Max. Hit Dice column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with hit dice as high as your druid level divided by 2, rounded down.</p><table><caption>Circle of the Moon Beast Shapes</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Max Hit Dice</th><th>Limitations</th></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>2</td><td>No flying, swimming, or burrow speed</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>No flying or burrow speed</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>3</td><td>No flying or burrow speed</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>4</td><td>No burrow speed</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>5</td><td>No burrow speed</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>6</td><td>—</td></tr></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>7</td><td>—</td></tr></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>8</td><td>—</td></tr></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>9</td><td>—</td></tr></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>10</td><td>—</td></tr></table>",

    "druidCircleFeature2":"<h3>Elemental Wild Shape</h3><p><i>Circle of the Moon Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an elemental instead of beast.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature3":"<h3>Thousand Forms</h3><p><i>Circle of the Moon Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 14th level, your mastery over Wild Shape has become apparent. You can Wild Shape into beasts that have 1 hit die or less without expending a use of Wild Shape. Additionally, using Elemental Wild Shape now only expends one use of Wild Shape.</p>",

    "druidCircle":"<h2>Circle of the Shepard</h2><hr><p>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</p><p>Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</p><h3>Speech of the Woods</h3><p><i>Circle of the Shepard Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</p><p>You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.</p><h3>Spirit Totem</h3><p><i>Circle of the Shepard Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 20 meters of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 10-meter radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 20 meters to a point you can see.</p><p>The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.</p><p><strong>Bear Spirit.</strong>The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + half your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</p><p><strong>Hawk Spirit.</strong>The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</p><p><strong>Unicorn Spirit.</strong>The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to half your druid level.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature1":"<h3>Mighty Summoner</h3><p><i>Circle of the Shepard Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li><li>The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li>",
    "druidCircleFeature2":"<h3>Guardian Spirit</h3><p><i>Circle of the Shepard Druid Feature</i></p><p>Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature3":"<h3>Faithful Summons</h3><p><i>Circle of the Shepard Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately gain the benefits of conjure animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice that have 4 hit dice or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 10 meters of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

    "druidCircle":"<h2>Circle of Spores</h2><hr><p>Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.</p><p>These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.</p><p>Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</p><h3>Circle Spells</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>Your symbiotic link to fungus and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table.</p><p>Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><table><caption>Circle of Spores Spells</caption><tr><th>Druid Level</th><th>Circle Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr></table><h3>Halo of Spores</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 3 meters of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.</p><h3>Symbiotic Entity</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.</li><li>These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.</li></ul>",
    "druidCircleFeature1":"<h3>Fungal Infestation</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 3 meters of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature is considered a zombie, and its stat block is based upon what creature it was before it was slain. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.</p><p>In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature2":"<h3>Spreading Spores</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 10 meters away, where they swirl in a 4-meter cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.</p><p>Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.</p><p>While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.</p>",
    "druidCircleFeature3":"<h3>Fungal Body</h3><p><i>Circle of Spores Druid Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, the fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.</p>",
