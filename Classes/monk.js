The drunken master's erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.</p><p>A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>Way of the Drunken Master Monk Class Feature</i></p><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it.

    "monasticTradition":"<h2>Way of the Elements</h2><hr><p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</p><p>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p><i>Way of the Elements Monk Class Feature</i></p><p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>The Way of the Elements Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish an extended rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot.</p><h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>You know two 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration, evocation, or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Way of the Elements Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a conjuration, evocation, or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 8th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a conjuration, evocation, or transmutation spell.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since you know your spells through dedication and practice. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><ul><li><strong>Spell save DC = 8</strong> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li><li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li></ul><table><caption>Way of the Elements Spellcasting</caption><tr><th colspan='2'></td><th colspan='4'><i>Spell Slots per Spell Level</i></td></tr><tr><th>Monk Level</th><th>Spells Known</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></table><h3>Elemental Strike</h3><p><i>Way of the Elements Monk Class Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can augment your weapon attacks with the power of the elements.

Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.</p><p>A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts.

Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons.

You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren’t incapacitated.</li><li><strong>Kensei's Shot.</strong> You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly.
