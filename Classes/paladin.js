    "sacredOath":"<h2>Oath of the Ancients</h2><hr><p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p><h3>Tenets of the Ancients</h3><p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</p><ul><li><strong>Kindle the Light.</strong> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</li><li><strong>Shelter the Light.</strong> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</li><li><strong>Preserve Your Own Light.</strong> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</li><li><strong>Be the Light.</strong> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</li></ul><h3>Oath Spells</h3><p><i>Oath of the Ancients Paladin Class Feature</i></p><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><table><caption>Oath of the Ancients Spells</caption><tr><th>Paladin Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td></td></tr></table><h3>Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath</h3><p><i>Oath of the Ancients Paladin Class Feature</i></p><p>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe.

These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.</p><h3>Tenets of the Crown</h3><p>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</p><ul><li><strong>Law.</strong> The law is paramount.

    "sacredOath":"<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2><hr><p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good.

    "sacredOath":"<h2>Oath of Redemption</h2><hr><p>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</p><p>While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil.

Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.</li><li><strong>Wisdom.</strong> Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good.
