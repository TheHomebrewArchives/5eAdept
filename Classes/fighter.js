    "martialArchetype":"<h2>Arcane Archer</h2><hr><p>An Arcane Archer studies a unique method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among those that are practicioners of archery. They stand watch over the fringes of domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach settlements.</p><h3>Arcane Archer Lore</h3><p><i>Arcane Archer Class Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of natureâ€”typical for practitioners of this martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Prima skill.</p><h3>Arcane Shot</h3><p><i>Arcane Archer Class Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see 'Arcane Shot Options' below).</p><p>Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p><h3>Arcane Shot Options</h3><p><i>Arcane Archer Class Feature</i></p><p>The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.</p><p>If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>Arcane Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li></ul><p><strong>Banishing Arrow.</strong> You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target's speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p><p>After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.<p><strong>Beguiling Arrow.</strong> Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 10 meters of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p><p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Bursting Arrow.</strong> You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 3 meters of it take 2d6 force damage each.</p><p>The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Enfeebling Arrow.</strong> You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p><p>The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Grasping Arrow.</strong> When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 4 meters, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 meter or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p><p>The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Piercing Arrow.</strong> You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 meter wide and 10 meters long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p><p>The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Seeking Arrow.</strong> Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p><p>The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<p><strong>Shadow Arrow.</strong> You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 2 meters away until the start of your next turn.</p><p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>",
    "martialArchetypeFeature1":"<h3>Magic Arrow</h3><p><i>Arcane Archer Class Feature</i></p><p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.</p><h3>Curving Shot</h3><p><i>Arcane Archer Class Feature</i></p><p>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target.

    "martialArchetype":"<h2>Banneret</h2><hr><p>Bannerets are warriors who take an oath of knighthood. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond their liege's borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</p><p>A Banneret inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p><p>A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight's actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</p><h3>Rallying Cry</h3><p><i>Banneret Class Feature</i></p><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.</p><p>When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to four creatures within 20 meters of you that are allied with you.

    "martialArchetypeFeature3":"<h3>Bulwark</h3><p><i>Banneret Class Feature</i></p><p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 20 meters of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>",

One ally within 20 meters of you gains advantage on the next attack roll they make before your next turn. You can use this feature once, and regain use when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

    "martialArchetype":"<h2>Battle Master</h2><hr><p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p><h3>Student of War</h3><p><i>Battle Master Class Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p><h3>Combat Supremecy</h3><p><i>Battle Master Class Feature</i></p><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p><p><strong>Maneuvers.</strong> You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are listed under 'Maneuvers' below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.</p><p>You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p><p><strong>Superiority Dice.</strong> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p><p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects.

When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p><p><strong>Disarming Attack.</strong>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to immediately make a Disarm maneuver. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll and maneuver check.</p><p><strong>Distracting Strike.</strong>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.

    "martialArchetype":"<h2>Cavalier</h2><hr><p>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner.

    "martialArchetype":"<h2>Eldritch Knight</h2><hr><p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magicâ€”abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p><i>Eldritch Knight Class Feature</i></p><p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p><p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action.
