Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Eloquence</h2><hr><p>Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more persuasive than facts. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.</p><h3>Silver Tongue</h3><p><i>College of Eloquence Feature</i></p><p>You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h3>Unsettling Words</h3><p><i>College of Eloquence Feature</i></p><p>You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 20 meters of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.

As an action, choose one or more creatures within 20 meters of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.</p>",

When a creature within 20 meters of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 20 meters of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.</p><p>You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>"

    "bardCollege":"<h2 id='BardCollege'>Bard College</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Glamour</h2><hr><p>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.</p><p>The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p><h3>Mantle of Inspiration</h3><p><i>College of Glamour Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see you within 20 meters of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><p>The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.</p><h3>Enthralling Performance</h3><p><i>College of Glamour Feature</i></p><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive, fey magic.</p><p>If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 20 meters of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.</p><p>If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",
    "collegeFeature1":"<h2 id='Countercharm'>Countercharm</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 10 meters of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p><h2 id='BardCollegeFeature1'>Bard College Feature</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Bard College.</p><h3>Mantle of Majesty</h3><p><i>College of Glamour Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast command, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a spell slot.</p><p>Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the command you cast with this feature.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
    "collegeFeature2":"<h2 id='MagicalSecrets2'>Magical Secrets</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, choose two additional spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p><p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p><h2 id='BardCollegeFeature2'>Bard College Feature</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, you gain a feature from your Bard College.</p><h3>Unbreakable Majesty</h3><p><i>College of Glamour Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.</p><p>In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.</p><p>Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"

    "bardCollege":"<h2 id='BardCollege'>Bard College</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Lore</h2><hr><p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p><p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p><p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Lore Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p><h3>Cutting Words</h3><p><i>College of Lore Feature</i></p><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 20 meters of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",

A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>",
    "collegeFeature2":"<h2 id='MagicalSecrets2'>Magical Secrets</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, choose two additional spells from any classes, including this one.

Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p>"

    "bardCollege":"<h2 id='BardCollege'>Bard College</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Swords</h2><hr><p>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p><p>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</p><p>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and a martial weapon of your choice that deals slashing damage.</p><p>If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon that deals slashing damage, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p><h3>Technique of Blades</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting favored by the blades as your specialty. When you are wielding a melee weapon that deals slashing damage, you can use your Charisma modifier in place of Strength for the attack and damage roll.</p><h3>Blade Flourish</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.</p><p>Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.</p><p><strong>Defensive Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Mobile Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 2 meters away from you, plus a number of meters equal to the number you roll on that die minus 1. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within reach of the target.</p><p><strong>Slashing Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within reach of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",

    "collegeFeature2":"<h2 id='MagicalSecrets2'>Magical Secrets</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, choose two additional spells from any classes, including this one.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Valor</h2><hr><p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Valor Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and one martial weapon of your choice.</p><h3>Combat Inspiration</h3><p><i>College of Valor Feature</i></p><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",

    "bardCollege":"<h2 id='BardCollege'>Bard College</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Whispers</h2><hr><p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p><p>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p><h3>Psychic Blades</h3><p><i>College of Whispers Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.</p><p>The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 10th level, and 5d6 at 15th level.</p><h3>Words of Terror</h3><p><i>College of Whispers Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.</p><p>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p><p>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies.

When a humanoid dies within 10 meters of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p><p>While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p><p>Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p><p>Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p><p>On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.</p><p>The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p><p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"
