      <h2>Welcome to AdroviaWorld!</h2>
      <h3>What is AdroviaWorld?</h3>
      <p>This website is a collection of all homebrew systems I use for playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. But, fair warning, I have changed substantially many of the base systems it uses. Here is a basic list of everything I have changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><i>Boons.</strong></i> By far the biggest change is that of adding a system known as Boons. Boons are a way to add exponentially more customizability to a given D&D character. This system replaces feats and ability score improvements. If you would like to see a list of all boons, look under "Player" above.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Measurement.</strong></i> The second biggest change is the conversion of measurement system from imperial units (feet, miles, gallons, etc.) to the metric system (meters, kilometers, liters, etc.). Therefore, where all distances previously described in feet or miles are now in terms of meters and kilometers. For example, whereas previously a standard battlemap square would be 5 feet, a standard battlemap square is now 1 meter.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Cultures.</strong></i> Unlike a standard D&D world, there are no distinct "species" of playable character. All characters are still human, but still belong to their own culture. Each culture has unique body types, customs, and relation to other cultures and people in the world. If you would like to see a list of all cultures, look under "Player" above.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Combat Maneuvers.</strong></i> Combat can become a little stale at times when all you can reasonably do is strike at an enemy with your sword over and over again. Therefore, I have added a small amount of additional depth to combat with combat maneuvers. Essentially, you can perform some sort of action against an enemy to give you an advantage in battle. Examples include grappling, sundering of weapons, lunging, tripping, etc. There are also many boons that make performing these maneuvers much more potent. If you would like a full explanation of combat maneuvers, look at "Combat" under "References" above.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Resting.</i></strong>I have always felt like recovering from all wounds in a single night was a little unbelievable, even for high fantasy. So, resting has been made a bit more realistic, with use of hit dice and extended rests. If you would like a breakdown of resting, look at "Adventuring" under "References" above.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Spell Variations.</strong></i> I believe that a given magical spellcaster's repertoire of spells should be unique as they are. As such, each spell has a variety of variations a caster can choose from when they learn it. Many of the changes are cosmetic, but others can be significant enough to border on warranting their own spell. Additionally, to go along with boons you have the choice of spending boon points to permenantly upgrade, or "augment" your spells. If you would like to see all spells, along with their variations and augmentations, look under "References".</li>
        <li><strong><i>Magic Items.</strong></i> Unlike many other worlds of D&D, magical items in Adrovia are each in an of themselves unique. There is no such thing as just a "+1 sword" or "bag of holding". Each magic item has a storied history, and unique abilities. For example, instead of a "+1 sword", an adventurer may encounter Blackcleave, the Sunderer of Madecon.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is all currently a huge undertaking, so a lot of the rules are incomplete. But, please do enjoy perusing the rules that are here! In the meantime, you can join the Homebrew Archives discord for progress reports and some random TTRPG talk. If you would like to use any rules for your own games, please feel free to do so and tell me how it goes! Playtesting is always extremely appreciated.</p>
